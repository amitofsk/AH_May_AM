# AH_May_AM
Here's my entry for the May 2023 AngelHack competition.

To make this a bit more fun, I'm going to try to write each entry in a different language.

The May 4 entry is written in Lua.
To get a lua compiler on an Ubuntu Linux box, use 
	sudo apt install lua5.3

The May 6 entry is written in Fortran.
To get a fortran compiler on an Ubuntu Linux box, use
	sudo apt-get install gfortran

The May 8 solution is written in Javascript embedded in html. 
You can just open the solution in a web browser.

The May 10 solution is written in Java. My solution is in the file Solution_10_5_2023.java.
Use something like the following to install a java compiler, compile,  and run the program:
	sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless
	javac Solution_10_5_2023.java
	java Solution_10_5_2023
I changed file naming conventions here because java class names must start with a letter.
the file may10_checker.sce is not part of my solution, but I included it anyways. I
wrote a little scilab script to double check my answer. As it is written, it doesn't 
give the actual score. However, I used it to calculate the score of subsets of the answer
to verify my Java code. My java code is the actual solution.
