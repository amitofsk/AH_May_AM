# AH_May_AM
Here's my entry for the May 2023 AngelHack competition.

To make this a bit more fun, I'm going to try to write each entry in a different language.

The May 4 entry is written in Lua.
To get a lua compiler on an Ubuntu Linux box, use 
	sudo apt install lua5.3

The May 6 entry is written in Fortran.
To get a fortran compiler on an Ubuntu Linux box, use
	sudo apt-get install gfortran
